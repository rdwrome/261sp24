# Homework - Functions

1. Read Chapter 10 "Lists" in "Think Python"

2. Write a program that prints out a graph of `y = x^2` (^2 means power of 2) horizontally. The print out of the graph should look like the following:

```
****************************************************************
*************************************************
************************************
*************************
****************
*********
****
*

*
****
*********
****************
*************************
************************************
*************************************************
****************************************************************
```

- Use the following template as a starting point:

```python
def print_graph(n):

def get_power(x, n):

for i in range(-8, 9):
```

- The `print_graph` function must print out the character **\*** `n` number of times in one line and creates a new line at the end.
- The `get_power` function must take in the base `x` and exponent `n` and return the result of power.
- Make sure to generate the graph in the range of -8 ~ 8.

3. SUBMIT (as a link in the OL to an assignment folder in *your* GitHub repository:
		- Your .py file
		- A documentation file (in Markdown as an .md file!) that includes:
		a) one thing you knew and one thing you did not know for the reading and
		b) documentation of the .py file as outlined in the syllabus.
